# Unemployment Rate Analysis on 30 European Nations
This thesis analyses how unemployment rates have changed across 30 European countries from 2013 to 2023, with a focus on the impact of major economic events such as the global financial post-crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic period. This study treats unemployment rates as continuous trends rather than discrete data points, which allows for the general comparison between countries and helps to gain a deeper understanding of how labour markets change over time. This research identifies distinct groups of countries that share similar unemployment patterns, using advanced clustering techniques, and compares the mean trends of individual groups. The main finding is that unemployment rates were very high in some countries at the beginning of the observation period, such as Greece and Spain; nonetheless, most European countries experienced a steady decline in unemployment over the decade, indicating a general economic recovery. Furthermore, it also demonstrates that the differences in unemployment rates between countries have decreased, suggesting a more unified European labour market. These insights could help policymakers and economists better understand the dynamics of the regional labour market and design more effective employment strategies.
